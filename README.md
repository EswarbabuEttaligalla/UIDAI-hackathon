AMEWS – Aadhaar Misuse Early-Warning System

A privacy-preserving, AI-powered internal monitoring system for detecting abnormal Aadhaar authentication behavior at national scale.

🛡️ Internal UIDAI Tool · 🤖 AI + Rule-Based Detection · 🔒 Privacy-by-Design

🔍 What is AMEWS?

AMEWS is an internal early-warning intelligence system designed for UIDAI to proactively detect Aadhaar misuse patterns before large-scale damage occurs.

Unlike complaint-based or reactive fraud systems, AMEWS:

Learns normal authentication behavior first

Detects behavioral deviations, not individual identities

Generates confidence-scored alerts for UIDAI analysts

Never accesses Aadhaar numbers, biometrics, or personal data

❌ What AMEWS is NOT

❌ Not a citizen complaint portal

❌ Not a consumer app (Paytm / PhonePe style)

❌ Not manual or rule-only monitoring

🚨 Problems AMEWS Addresses

Device-level velocity attacks

Excessive OTP fallback abuse

Off-hours authentication spikes

Regional anomalies and coordinated misuse

Service-provider-level abnormal behavior

💡 Key Innovations

Baseline Learning Phase (14 days)
Learns regional and service-specific “normal” behavior before alerting
→ reduces false positives by 60–80%

Hybrid Detection Engine
Rule-based logic (explainable) + ML anomaly detection (Isolation Forest)

Confidence & Actionability
Every alert includes:

Risk score

Confidence level

Recommended response tier

Equity Guardrail
Risk scores normalized per region to avoid penalizing low-connectivity areas

Privacy-by-Design
Metadata only · One-way hashing · Aggregation-only analysis

🏗️ High-Level Architecture

Frontend: React + Material UI (analyst dashboard)

Backend: FastAPI (risk engine, simulations, alerts)

Database: DuckDB (analytical workloads)

ML: Isolation Forest (behavioral anomaly detection)

📄 Full architecture and design details are available in the project report (PDF).

View generated alerts under Alerts

Alerts are auto-generated by the system, not manually created.

🔐 Privacy Guarantee

AMEWS never collects or processes:

Aadhaar numbers (UID)

Biometric data

Personal demographic details

Phone numbers or email IDs

Exact addresses or locations

Only synthetic, anonymized authentication metadata is used.
